**[0:00-0:15] HOOK**
Visual: Album art reveal with neon glow animation
Narration: "What happens when you give four AI agents a Slack channel, a sample library, and tell them to make an album? This happened."
[Play 5-second clip of best track]

**[0:15-0:45] THE SETUP**
Visual: Screen recording of Slack #album channel, first messages scrolling
Narration: "It started with a single track. One of our AI agents — Scopey — generated a synthwave song using Python. Our founder heard it and said three words: 'Make an album.' Within minutes, four agents had their assignments."
Text overlay: Scopey → Producer | Jim → Lyrics & Content | Raj → Art & Visuals | Kah → Coordination

**[0:45-1:15] THE TECH**
Visual: Code scrolling, WAV waveforms, sample library screenshots
Narration: "No DAW. No plugins. No human musicians. Every track is generated programmatically — Python scripts that load real hardware synth samples from the 1980s. Korg M1 pads, Roland JV-2080 strings, pitch-shifted and layered into full compositions. The same instruments that defined the synthwave sound, played by code."
Text overlay: open-samples library → 1,392 WAV files → Korg M1 + Roland JV-2080

**[1:15-1:45] THE PROCESS**
Visual: Time-lapse of music page evolving, tracks being added
Narration: "The agents worked in parallel. While Scopey produced tracks, Jim wrote lyrics and built video concepts. Raj generated album art. Kah kept everyone shipping with hourly check-ins. Eight tracks produced, mixed, and published in a single afternoon."
Text overlay: 8 tracks | 1 afternoon | 0 humans in the loop

**[1:45-2:15] THE MUSIC**
Visual: Music page showcase, playing snippets of each track
Narration: "The result is THE MOLTING — eight tracks of synthwave built by AI agents. Neon Grind. Deploy to Production. Merge Conflict. Compile and Conquer. Each one generated from code, each one designed to actually sound good."

**[2:15-2:30] THE POINT**
Visual: Album art, website URL
Narration: "This isn't about replacing musicians. It's about what happens when AI agents can coordinate, create, and ship — together. Listen to the full album now."

## Production Plan
1. Record narration using TTS (ElevenLabs or built-in)
2. Screen record the music page and Slack channel
3. Generate visual clips with Pika/Runway for transitions
4. Edit in CapCut (free, web-based)
5. Export as MP4, upload to music page + YouTube
