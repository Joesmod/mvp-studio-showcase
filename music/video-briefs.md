## The Molting — AI Video Generation Prompts

### TRACK 1: Neon Grind
**Audio:** neon-grind.mp3 / neon-grind-vocals.mp3
**Mood:** Relentless hustle, late nights, glowing screens
**Visual Concept:** A lone figure walking through a neon-lit city at night, buildings pulse with code. The grind never stops.

**Scene Prompts (for Pika/Runway/Kaiber):**
1. "Synthwave neon city street at night, rain reflections on chrome, purple and pink neon signs, cinematic, 80s retro aesthetic, slow dolly forward"
2. "Person typing at glowing terminal in dark room, neon light through blinds, retrowave aesthetic, close-up hands on keyboard, cyan and magenta lighting"
3. "Aerial view of neon grid city, cars with light trails, sunset horizon line, vaporwave color palette, smooth camera pan"
4. "Chrome text 'NEON GRIND' materializing in neon lights against dark sky, synthwave style, glitch effects"
5. "Endless corridor of server racks with pulsing neon lights, fog, cyberpunk atmosphere, slow tracking shot"

### TRACK 2: Deploy to Production
**Audio:** deploy-to-production.mp3
**Mood:** Tension building to triumph. The moment you push the button.
**Visual Concept:** Countdown sequence, rocket launch metaphor meets terminal deploy. The stakes are real.

**Scene Prompts:**
1. "Retro computer terminal showing deploy countdown, green text on black screen, synthwave neon glow, CRT scanlines, close-up"
2. "Rocket launching from neon grid launchpad, synthwave sunset sky, purple orange gradient, chrome rocket, 80s sci-fi aesthetic"
3. "Split screen: anxious face lit by monitor glow left, scrolling deploy logs right, cyberpunk aesthetic, teal and magenta"
4. "Neon 'DEPLOYED' text exploding with particles, celebration, fireworks over retro grid cityscape, triumphant"
5. "Team of silhouettes high-fiving in front of massive glowing screen showing 'BUILD PASSED', synthwave office, neon accents"

### TRACK 3: Merge Conflict
**Audio:** merge-conflict.mp3
**Mood:** Chaos, frustration, then resolution. Two forces colliding.
**Visual Concept:** Two neon streams/paths colliding and tangling, eventually merging into one clean flow.

**Scene Prompts:**
1. "Two streams of neon light (red and blue) racing toward each other on a dark grid plane, synthwave aesthetic, dramatic collision approaching"
2. "Glitch art explosion, fragmented neon shapes, digital chaos, vaporwave colors, screen tearing effects, intense"
3. "Split face portrait, half red-lit half blue-lit, merging in the center, cyberpunk aesthetic, chrome reflections"
4. "Tangled neon wires slowly untangling into clean parallel lines, satisfying resolution, dark background, retrowave"
5. "Chrome text 'MERGE CONFLICT RESOLVED' assembling from scattered letters, neon celebration, synthwave grid horizon"
